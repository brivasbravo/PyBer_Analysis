# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
Purpose of this presentation for V.Isualize is to understand total weekly fares, average fares, # of drivers and average fare per driver
by each city type(Suburban, Urban, Rural). This will help V.Isualize regarding how to allocate resources to further grow the company. We 
will be using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Python to assist us with this analysis.

## Results

There are large differences between each type of city.

### Total Rides:

Analysis table shows Urban area has the largest amount of total rides at 1625, Suburban area with only 625 total rides, and lastly
125 total rides in a Rural area.

### Total Drivers:

Size of an area also affects total drivers. Due to higher density from apartments, corporations, and nightlife the urban area has
2405 drivers while suburban area only has 490 and both dwarf rural at a measly 78 drivers. 

### Total Fare:

Size of an area also proportionally affects total fares. Urban area is bringing in almost 40K so about 200% of what suburban area is
pulling in at ~20K and lastly almost 1000% more compared to rural area.

### Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver

This is interesting and data makes sense in this situation. Due to larger distances traversed in rural areas, this then affects average
fare per driver and ride and pushes the fare much higher than say urban or suburban where distance traversed is potential smaller due
to closer proximity to destination.

## Summary

- First recommendation to assist with revenue is to sell add on services such as food delivery within the app. This can help V.Isualize
further grow in the future.

- Second recommendation is to add ride sharing option for long distances. This can assist with reducing price for all area types. This
is especially needed in rural areas since fares are quite high which puts V.Isualize at risk to losing to a competitor that focuses on rural.


- Third recommendation is to expand to other types of transportation within the urban areas. V.Isualize can partner with biking company
to rent out bikes for short distances instead of relying solely on vehicular transportation. This could help with reducing price for 
shorter distances which in turn helps beat our competition.
